DESIGN PATTERN - OBSERVER
==============
TYPE - BEHAVIORAL
--------------


The **Observer** pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

This example uses the Java built-in Observer Pattern - java.util.Observer & java.util.Observable

The pull method is used for the observer, ChannelingDisplay, to grab Stock price changes from the subject(observable) StockData
