DESIGN PATTERN - ABSTRACT FACTORY 
==============

TYPE - CREATIONAL
--------------

The **Abstract Factory** pattern 

All factory patterns encapsulate object creation.

The Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Factories are a powerful technique for coding to abstractions, not concrete classes

**Examples of the Factory Method Pattern in the JDK include**

javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory#newInstance()
javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory#newInstance()
javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory#newInstance()
