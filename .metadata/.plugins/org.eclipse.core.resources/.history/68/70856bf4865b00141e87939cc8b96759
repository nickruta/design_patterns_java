DESIGN PATTERN - STRATEGY
TYPE - BEHAVIORAL

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

The "Client" (Motorcycle - Cruiser and Sport) makes use of an encapsulated family of algorithms (DriveBehavior) for Driving. 

The set of behaviors, DriveAtEase and DriveFastAndFurious are a family of algorithms named DriveBehavior.

The algorithms are interchangeable.
