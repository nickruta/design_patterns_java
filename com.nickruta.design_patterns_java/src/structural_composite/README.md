DESIGN PATTERN - COMMAND
==============
TYPE - BEHAVIORAL
--------------

The **Command** pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with 
different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

The **Meta Command Pattern** allows you to create macros of commands so that you can can execute multiple commands at once.

**Examples of the Command Pattern in the JDK include**

java.lang.Runnable
javax.swing.Action
