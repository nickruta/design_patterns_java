DESIGN PATTERN - ADAPTER
==============

TYPE - STRUCTURAL
--------------

The **Adapter** pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces


Java JDK Examples include - 

java.util.Arrays#asList()
java.io.InputStreamReader(InputStream) (returns a Reader)
java.io.OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream) (returns a Writer)
javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter#marshal() and #unmarshal()

Page 251 in Head First Design Patterns shows an Adapter for Iterator from Enumeration in Java API
